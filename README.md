# Beep Baseball 2023 Stats

#### Introduction

Welcome to the Beep Baseball 2023 Stats project! This README outlines my involvement in a volunteer project focusing on a beep baseball league. Within this project, I analyze league statistics to identify the Most Valuable Player (MVP), highlight top defensive players, and recognize outstanding offensive performers.

## What is Beep Baseball?

Beep baseball, also known as blind baseball, is an adaptive version of traditional baseball specifically designed for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.

## Equipment

- **Beeping Ball**: The ball used in beep baseball emits a beeping sound, enabling players to locate it by sound.
- **Bases**: The bases also emit a beeping sound to help players locate them while running.

## Gameplay

1. **Teams**: Beep baseball is typically played between two teams of visually impaired or blind individuals.
   
2. **Field Layout**: The field layout is modified from traditional baseball to accommodate visually impaired players, with a distance of approximately 100 feet between bases.

3. **Pitching and Batting**: 
   - The pitcher and batter are on the same team. The pitcher calls out a signal to indicate when they are ready to pitch, and the batter listens for the signal and swings at the ball based on the sound.
   - The batter's goal is to hit the ball into play and then locate the beeping base to score a run.

4. **Fielding**: 
   - Fielders position themselves in the field and use auditory cues to locate the beeping ball. Once the ball is hit, fielders attempt to retrieve it and make a play to prevent runs from scoring.

5. **Scoring**: 
   - Runs are scored by successfully reaching a designated beeping base before the fielding team retrieves the ball and tags the base.

## Benefits

Beep baseball provides individuals who are blind or visually impaired with an opportunity to participate in a team sport, promoting physical activity, teamwork, and social interaction. It requires a combination of auditory skills, spatial awareness, and physical coordination, making it both challenging and rewarding for players.
